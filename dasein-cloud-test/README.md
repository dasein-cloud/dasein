dasein-cloud-test
=================

The Dasein Cloud automated testing suite tests the behavior of individual Dasein Cloud implementations against their
target clouds with respect to the behavior clients should expected from them. In other words, it is the set of tests
that a developer of a Dasein Cloud implementation like [dasein-cloud-aws](https://github.com/greese/dasein-cloud-aws)
uses to verify the functioning of that implementation against a cloud like AWS. If you are looking for tools to verify
your application code, look at [dasein-cloud-mock](https://github.com/greese/dasein-cloud-mock).
