      Provides access to compute services such as a virtual machine support, volume support, and other features
      associated with cloud compute as a service. The most common interaction with this package is to first call
      {@link org.dasein.cloud.CloudProvider#getComputeServices} to get access to compute services via
      {@link org.dasein.cloud.compute.ComputeServices}. The compute services are then used to access the
      different kinds of supported resources like virtual machines
      ({@link org.dasein.cloud.compute.ComputeServices#getVirtualMachineSupport}).
